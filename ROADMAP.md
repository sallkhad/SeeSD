## Project: SeeSD (Science Education Exchange for Sustainable Development)
# Problems
The colonial history of Africa has led to a serious lack of scientific literacy amongst its citizens. 
The consequences today are fear and skepticism towards science, with people perceiving it as foreign led and irrelevant to their lives. 
Many africans often lack the scientific literacy to assess situations. 
As a result, their opinions are misinformed by rhetoric and shaped by cultural mistrust.
Senegal is a perfect illustration of this lack of scientific literacy.
# Our Mission  
At SeeSD, we are committed to fostering Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, encouraging critical thinking, and scientific literacy from K-12 and beyond in Senegal.

Our project will develop around three phases:
1) Hands-on workshops ---> 
2) MOOC platform (Afreecademy) ---> Designing Open education resources in local languages allows us to expand their access to local people and create a more inclusive society.
3) Conference ---> provide opportunities for networking and partnerships between STEM professionals in Senegal and around the world.

The first year is dedicated to 1) Hands-on workshops. 
We are running weekly hands-on workshops for K-6 students.
We have offered workshops related to biology, physics, chemistry, environment, design, 3D printing, coding, and electronics.
The next phase of this project will be to expand the workshops to K-12 and design similar workshops to assist students in having a better
understading of their current school curriculum.
We are also working on establishing a hackerspace/makerspace/biohackerspace to provide our comuni
We will initiate parternships with private schools as a way to generate incomes and sustain the hands-on workshops. 

This will be updated regularly so check back! 


The second year will be dedicated to establishing Afreecademy. We are currently working on developing the online MOOC platform. 
The goal will be to provide open educational resources adapted to local challenges and available in local languages. 


The third year will be dedicated to organizing our first conference for university graduates around Science communication and Open Science. 


## Timeline
### Early April 2017-June 2017
 - continue running weekly Hands-on workshops with K-6 students
 - Establish budget for makerspace (items needed, budget) 
 - Find funding to provide employment opportunitues for three volunteers (very invested in the project).

 - Update the website to reflect the current leadership team and add achievements we have obtained for the past
 - Initiate feasibily studies for the science center model
 - Establish more advances curriculum for K-12. 
 - Create methods for evaluating the workshops
 - Establish a strategy on how to make the future makerspace into a hub where the community come to learn through the workshops we offered
 or work on their own DIY and get assistance from the makerspace team.
 - Discuss with team already designing tools and classes in wolof and
