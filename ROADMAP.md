## Project: SeeSD (Science Education Exchange for Sustainable Development)

# Our Mission  
At SeeSD, we are committed to fostering Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, encouraging critical thinking, and scientific literacy from K-12 and beyond in Senegal.

Our project will develop around three phases:
1) Hands-on workshops --->  Establish a makerspace to advocate for open and collaborative practices. 
2) MOOC platform (Afreecademy) ---> Designing Open education resources in local languages allows us to expand their access to local people and create a more inclusive society.
3) Conference ---> provide opportunities for networking and partnerships between STEM professionals in Senegal and around the world.

The first year is dedicated to 1) Hands-on workshops. 
We are running weekly hands-on workshops for K-6 students.
We have offered workshops related to biology, physics, chemistry, the environment, design, 3D printing, coding, and electronics.
The next phase of this project will be to expand the workshops to K-12 and design similar workshops to assist students in having a better
understanding of their current school curriculum.
We are also working on establishing a hackerspace/makerspace/biohackerspace to provide a space for training and collaborative work.

We will initiate parternships with private schools as a way to generate incomes and sustain the hands-on workshops. 

This will be updated regularly so check back! 


The second year will be dedicated to establishing Afreecademy. We are currently working on developing the online MOOC platform. 
The goal will be to provide open educational resources adapted to local challenges and available in local languages. 


The third year will be dedicated to organizing our first conference for university graduates around Science communication and Open Science.
