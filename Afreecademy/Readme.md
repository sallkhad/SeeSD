Afreecademy - MOOC platform with content available in local languages
============

Welcome to [Afreecademy](http://afreecademy.org). Afreecademy is a MOOC platform under development (We need help help for web development). Through Afreecademy, we will offer culturally relevant content that are available in local languages. 

This is a blog post written by SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) about [Afreecademy](http://www.opportunitiesforafricans.com/2016-opencon-conference-for-studentearly-career-professionals-washington-dc-usa-fully-funded-scholarships-available/)

We are currently designing the MOOC platform and need help from more developpers. 

Coming soon. 

We are setting this up and will need more collaborators.
