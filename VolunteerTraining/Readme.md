SeeSD Volunteer Training - for hands-on workhops and Open practices 
============

Welcome to SeeSD Volunteer training. We are currently designing a one week training session for our volunteers. 

If you have curricula to share or something you believe will be a good add-up to the training, please contribute.  

Temptative training.
