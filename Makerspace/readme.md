Welcome to Ubbil SeeSD Makerspace.

============

## Ubbil SeeSD is an open education, open science and open innovation space. 

This year, we are supported by the Clinton Foundation, Oregon State University and by our kind donors. 

We come together to do hands-on learning, share skills, ask questions, and create technologies. 

We believe anyone can become a STEM professional and an innovator. 

### :confused: :unamused: What do you guys teach in the makerspace? :confused: :unamused:

We have run hands-on workshops related to Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, The environment, Climate change, coding, electronics, 3D printing.:smirk: :+1:

We are working on designing  more hands-on workshops (photography, drones, data mining and visualization, African Fractals). :sunglasses:

If you are interested in learning something about a specific field and/or help design or share a STEM curriculum with underreprensented communities. We can help with that.:sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses:

OK Hnn! :unamused:

I am not a STEM professional or innovator, I don't know what you guys are talking about. :confused::confused:
Well, just come and have fun learning with us then. Innovation comes with learning. :smiley: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes::stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

Our workshops are fit to adapt to different background and vibes. :sunglasses::sunglasses::sunglasses:

If you have STEM skills to share :microscope: books: :telescope::wrench: :computer::syringe:, or want to help design currical we are interested! :simple_smile:
 
If you are already a STEM professional or an innovator in Senegal, just show up. 

We have co-working events to work on your own projects. 

### :raised_hand: Wait, who are you? :smirk:

We are mostly young people who want to make a change in Africa.:muscle::muscle::muscle: We believe scientific literacy :microscope: books: :telescope::wrench: :computer::syringe: mixed with the culture of open can get us there. 
Some of us have PhD and have a lot experience, while others are just starting.

This is our leadership team [SeeSD](https://www.seesd.org/team).:runner::bowtie::runner:
