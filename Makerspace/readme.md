Welcome to Ubbil SeeSD Makerspace. 
============

## Ubbil SeeSD is an open education, open science and open innovation space. 

This year, we are supported by the Clinton Foundation, Oregon State University and by our kind donors. 

We come together to do hands-on learning, share skills, ask questions, and create technologies. 

We believe anyone can become a STEM professional and an innovator. Our goal is to help you start from scratch. 

### Wait, how what do you guys teach?

We have run hands-on workshops related to Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, The environment, Climate change, coding, electronics, 3D printing. 

We are working on designing many more hands-on workshops (photography, drones, data mining and visualization, African Fractals). 

You are interesting in learning something about a specific field, name it and we are going to guide you or find people who can guide you. 

Oh My God! 

I am not a innovator, I don't know what you guys are talking about. 

Our workshops are fit to adapt to different background and vibes. Just come not pressure, we will learn together. With learning comes innovation.

If you are already an innovator just show up. We have co-working events to work on your own projects. We can work together.

### Wait who are you guys? 

We are mostly young people who want to make a change in Africa. We believe scientific literacy mixed with the culture of open can get us there. 
Some of us have PhD and have a lot experience, while others are just starting.

This is our leadership team so far [SeeSD](https://www.seesd.org/team)

But Hey, just join us, we will train you and assist you in anyway we can because we believe the future of the continent is in your hands.
