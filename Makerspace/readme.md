Welcome to Ubbil SeeSD Makerspace. 
============

## Ubbil SeeSD is an open education, open science and open innovation space. 

This year, we are supported by the Clinton Foundation, Oregon State University and by our kind donors. 

We come together to do hands-on learning, share skills, ask questions, and create technologies. 

We believe anyone can become a STEM professional and an innovator. Our goal is to help people start from scratch. 

### Wait, what d you guys teach in the makerspace?

We have run hands-on workshops related to Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Math, The environment, Climate change, coding, electronics, 3D printing. 

We are working on designing  more hands-on workshops (photography, drones, data mining and visualization, African Fractals). 

You are interesting in learning something about a specific field and/or help design curriculum on a specific field and share with underreprensented communities. We can help with that.

Hnn! 

I am not a STEM professional or innovator, I don't know what you guys are talking about. 

If you have STEM skills to share, we are interested. Our workshops are fit to adapt to different background and vibes. Just help out or come in the makerspace to learn with us. No, pressure at all, we will learn together. With learning comes innovation. 

If you are already a STEM professional or an innovator just show up. We have co-working events to work on your own projects. We can work together and create curricula.

### Wait who are you guys? 

We are mostly young people who want to make a change in Africa. We believe scientific literacy mixed with the culture of open can get us there. 
Some of us have PhD and have a lot experience, while others are just starting.

This is our leadership team [SeeSD](https://www.seesd.org/team). We are looking for more leaders. 

If you think you have are a leader, join us, and let share skills and work together. 

Check out the CONTRIBUTING file or the page on the site for more details.
