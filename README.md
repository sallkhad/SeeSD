:clipboard: **Our Problems:** :clipboard:

The colonial history of Africa has led to a serious lack of scientific literacy amongst its citizens.The consequences today are fear and skepticism towards science, with people perceiving it as foreign led and irrelevant to their lives. Many africans often lack the scientific literacy to assess situations.As a result, their opinions are misinformed by rhetoric and shaped by cultural mistrust.
Senegal is a perfect illustration of this lack of scientific literacy.


:clipboard: **Our Mission:** :clipboard:

At SeeSD, we are committed to fostering Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, encouraging critical thinking, and scientific literacy from K-12 and beyond in Senegal.
